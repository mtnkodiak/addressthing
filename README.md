# addressthing
a coding exercise

This is a project that was assigned to me by a technical recruiter.

The current state of this project is "proof of concept".  There is still a lot of work to do before I would consider this project to be complete in any way.  This is the first time I have had the chance to develop a complete front-end/back-end application-- historically I have always been adding to or maintaining an existing system.  There were a lot of tool interdependencies that I had to work out to even start developing the code!

Tools/frameworks used in development:
JQuery + JQuery UI
Ajax
Apache Tomcat
JUnit
JSON (Gson)

Next steps in development:
Error handling!  - error handling is very basic now.  Some exceptions are caught, but not handled very well.
UI enhancements - the UI is very bare-bones.  Needs more CSS styling and polish.
More tests - I started in my usual TDD fashion, but quickly ran out of time.  It needs a more complete testbed.
Bug fixing - I could probably write up a dozen bugs right now that should be addressed.

In all, I am glad I had the opportunity to build an app like this, and I learned a lot along the way.
